## 🔐 Admin Credentials (Test Demo)

- **Email:** `admin@videocrew.com`
- **Password:** `Test@123`

**Note:** Used the provided test admin credentials from project documentation instead of API testing credentials.

---

## 🧠 Assumptions Made

- Single admin system — no role-based access for now
- All uploads are trusted and admin-only
- Admin panel is not meant for public access or self-registration

- **Reusable Components:** Implemented modular, reusable component architecture
- **Cross-Device Testing:** Thoroughly tested on desktop and mobile devices
- **Image/Video Optimization:** All media assets are optimized for performance
- **Clean Code:** Well-commented, maintainable codebase following best practices
- **Scope Adherence:** Only implemented requested features without deviation from requirements
- **Feature Completion:** All required features from the specification have been implemented
- **Missing Features:** Some design elements like gradient block backgrounds couldn't be implemented due to frontend and time constraints
- **Development Timeline:** Completed in 7 days as a full-stack TypeScript project
- **First Full-Stack Project:** This represents my first complete full-stack website implementation
